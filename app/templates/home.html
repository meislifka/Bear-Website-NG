    <h2> The Hunt </h2>
    <h1>  There exists a theory that there is a bear reference in every episode of new girl.
            I created this website to compile all the bear references in the show New girl.
            While the creator of the show Elizabeth Meriwether states it was not intentional, I believe the hunt should go on.
            <br> <br> 
            Use the panel on the left to navigate to different seasons and episodes to see the bear spottings!

     <h6>"<i>I mean look, it's never a fools errand to look for a bear in every episode of the show. 
     Yeah, no I - [It] definitely wasn't intentional, I do love - I do think that bears are like very funny, 
     I think it's a funny word. And - I think it like - I just remember, in the pilot, Daemon being like "Bears" 
     and like that - [I] just remember like that was just like a funny moment in the pilot. I- yeah I, yeah you know, 
     I hate to disappoint you, it definitely wasn't intentional. But I think like subconsiously there are probably a like 
     million bears in the show because like -you know -like when you think something is funny or like a funny word, you just 
     keep going for it"
