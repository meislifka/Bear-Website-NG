    <h2> The Hunt! </h2>
    <h1> There exists a theory that there is a bear reference in every episode of new girl.
      I created this website to compile all the bear references in the show New girl.
      While the creator of the show Elizabeth Meriwether states it was not intentional, I believe the hunt should
      go on.
      <br> <br>
      Use the panel on the left to navigate to different seasons and episodes to see the bear spottings!

    <h6>"<i>I mean look, it's never a fools errand to look for a bear in every episode of the show.
        Yeah, no I - [It] definitely wasn't intentional, I do love - I do think that bears are like very funny,
        I think it's a funny word. And - I think it like - I just remember, in the pilot, Daemon being like
        "Bears"
        and like that - [I] just remember like that was just like a funny moment in the pilot. I- yeah I, yeah
        you know,
        I hate to disappoint you, it definitely wasn't intentional. But I think like subconsiously there are
        probably a like
        million bears in the show because like -you know -like when you think something is funny or like a funny
        word, you just
        keep going for it"
