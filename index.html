    <p id="theory"> There exists a theory that there is a bear reference in every episode of new girl.
      I created this website to combine two things I like: programming and sit coms! <br><br> I also wanted to
      compile all the bear references in the show New Girl. While the creator of the show Elizabeth Meriwether
      states it was not intentional, I believe the hunt should go on.

      Use the panel on the left to navigate to different seasons and episodes to see the bear spottings!

    <p class="quote">"<i>I mean look, it's never a fools errand to look for a bear in every episode of the show.
        Yeah, no I - [It] definitely wasn't intentional, I do love - I do think that bears are like very funny,
        I think it's a funny word. And - I think it like - I just remember, in the pilot, Daemon being like
        "Bears" and like that - [I] just remember like that was just like a funny moment in the pilot. I- yeah I, yeah
        you know, I hate to disappoint you, it definitely wasn't intentional. But I think like subconsiously there are
        probably a like million bears in the show because like -you know -like when you think something is funny or like
        a funny
        word, you just keep going for it"
